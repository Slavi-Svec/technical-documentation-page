                    <p>React is a JavaScript library, and so we’ll assume you have a basic understanding of the JavaScript language.
                        If you don’t feel very confident, we recommend going through a JavaScript tutorial to check your knowledge level
                        and enable you to follow along this guide without getting lost. It might take you between 30 minutes and an hour,
                         but as a result you won’t have to feel like you’re learning both React and JavaScript at the same time.
                    </p>
                    <p>An example of React is:</p>
                    <code><xmp>ReactDOM.render(
                            <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
                            document.getElementById('root')
                          );</xmp></code>
                    <P>The following chapters will further demonstrate React so you can better understand its set up and concepts.</P>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Getting_started">
                <header>Getting Started</header>
                    <p>Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new
                        single-page application in React.
                        It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience,
                        and optimizes your app for production. You’ll need to have Node >= 8.10 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. To create a project, run:</p>
                    <code><xmp>npx create-react-app my-app
                            cd my-app
                            npm start</xmp></code>
                    <p> Create React App doesn’t handle backend logic or databases; it just creates a frontend build pipeline, so you can use it with
                         any backend you want. Under the hood, it uses Babel and webpack, but you don’t need to know anything about them.
                         When you’re ready to deploy to production, running npm run build will create an optimized build of your app in the build folder.
                         You can learn more about Create React App from its README and the User Guide.</p>

                <header>Introducing JSX</header>
                    <h4>Consider this variable declaration:</h4>
                <code><xmp> const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;</xmp></code>
                    <p>This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.
                    It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.
                    JSX produces React “elements”. We will explore rendering them to the DOM in the next section. Below, you can find the basics of JSX necessary to get you started.
                    </p>

                    <p><br>React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.
                    Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both. We will come back to components in a further section, but if you’re not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, this talk might convince you otherwise.
                    React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the example below, we declare a variable called name and then use it inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces:</p>
                    <code><xmp>const name = 'Benny Hill';
                            const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;

                            ReactDOM.render(
                              element,
                              document.getElementById('root')
                            );</xmp></code>
                    <p>In the example below, we embed the result of calling a JavaScript function, formatName(user), into an <xmp><h1></xmp> element.</p>

                    <code><xmp>function formatName(user) {
                            return user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName;
                          }

                          const user = {
                            firstName: 'Benny',
                            lastName: 'Hill'
                          };

                          const element = (
                            <h1>
                              Hello, {formatName(user)}!
                            </h1>
                          );

                          ReactDOM.render(
                            element,
                            document.getElementById('root')
                          );</xmp></code>

                    One of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about apps as you build them. In this document, we’ll walk you through the thought

                    <p>  Hopefully, this gives you an idea of how to think about building components and applications with React. While it may be a little more typing than you’re used to, remember that code is read far more than it’s written, and it’s less difficult to read this modular, explicit code. As you start to build large libraries of components, you’ll
                        appreciate this explicitness and modularity, and with code reuse, your lines of code will start to shrink. :) </p>
